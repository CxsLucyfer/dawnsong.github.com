Help myself.
Make a good life.
Be positive.
Work harder to improve.

Test some math:
$$
\[ i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \left(
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
    + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
    + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
  \right) \psi + V \psi \]
$$
